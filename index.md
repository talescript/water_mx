# Mexico City's Water Crisis

**Problem**: Mexico's water problems are numerous and complex. In 1950 mexico had 18,000 m<sup>3</sup> of water per capita per year. In 2015 it decreased to 3,692 m<sup>3</sup> per capita per year. Among some of the problems, some areas in Mexico suffer from the following:

* Water pressure
* Poor payment rates and high (or low) tariffs.
    * On average only 72% off all bills are paid.
    * 31% of water customers are charged a flat rate independant of consumption.
* High consumption of water in some areas. i.e., Tlalpan.

_<strong>Note:</strong> The statistics might be outdated. They were compiled from various online sources and may not refer solely to mexico city_


**Proposed solution**: Behavioral change using a two fold system.


* Water valves with timers and voice control
A limit to consumption. Anything above will be charged accordingly.

* WHO proposes between 50 and 100 litres of water per person per day. 
Charging for anything above proposed X amount. Look into how much water 
is concusmed on average by the Mexican person.

* Mexicos average consumption is at 184.6 litres. The highest average is in Tlalpan at 560 liters per habitant while in Venustiano Carranza it was at 203 liters. This was in 2015.

* Faucet - auto shut off, voice control to activate for short period
 
* manual control better.
